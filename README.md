# Pony Workshop

This is the repo for the Pony workshop. There are numbered subdirectories under `steps`, each of which contains a small program that demonstrates some Pony ideas.

If you are presenting this workshop, please see the [README for presenters](README_FOR_PRESENTERS.md).

## Preparation

[Pony](https://ponylang.org) is a fast actor-based programming language that guarantees that programs will not have data races. This workshop will teach participants about some of Pony's core ideas and patterns by having them write a series of small programs that culminate in a simple chat server. Topics covered will include Pony's actor system, reference capabilities, and working with the compiler. Attendees should bring a laptop with the following software installed: [the Pony compiler](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc) via [`ponyup`](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyup), and a telnet client. They should also clone [the workshop git repository](https://github.com/aturley/pony-workshop).
